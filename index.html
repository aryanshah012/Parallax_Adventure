                <p class="text">
                    I was excited to learn how to ride a bike without training wheels, so I could be like my brother and father. The thing I didn’t know is that I would be a confident and adventurous person. I learned that doing what your parents says is the safest way to doing anything.

                    <br>
                    Biking is a great way of exercise, not only is it really beneficial, it can be really fun too!

                <p class="text">
                   Paragliding is a sport in which the players fly in the air using paragliders. These paragliders are light in weight and are foot launched. There is a harness in the glider on which the paraglider sits. This harness is interconnected to the glider with baffled cells.

                    <br>
                    Paragliding is an extreme sport that requires daring and a strong heart to play. A player has to fly above a huge height from the ground and needs to show his/her skill. Though the content of this tutorial is not broad enough to cover all the aspects of paragliding, it has sufficient details to supplement an unknown user with necessary details.

                <p class="text">
                    I loved being surrounded in the translucent ocean water, so I decided I wanted to surf. My dad was kind enough to rent me a surfboard for the week, so i could learn how to surf. The day had finally come, and I was very eager to begin.

                    <br>
                   The sport of surfing provides opportunities for both relaxation and excitement, as athletes can enjoy the beauty of the ocean while also seeking out challenging waves to ride.
